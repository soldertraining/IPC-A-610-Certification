# IPC-A-610-Certification
The IPC-A-610 Acceptability of Electronic Assemblies is a worldwide standard for the inspection of electronic assemblies published by the
IPC. It is the source for end product acceptance criteria for the consumer; standard use, as well as high reliability, printed wiring 
assemblies. 

The IPC-A-610 certification program is an industry-developed and approved program. It takes training, certification and instructional 
materials based on the IPC-A-610 is available to your company. This certification program will help you meet customer requirements as 
well as develop any company dedicated to ISO-9000 or other quality assurance initiatives.

If you adopt the IPC-A-610 training and certification it would bring your company recognition and legitimacy through the electronics 
industry. A lot of companies have trained individuals in their respective organizations as Certified IPC Trainers (CITs). The IPC-A-610
training and certification provide certified IPC trainers with training materials and detailed plans for training application 
specialists (CIS)including those in quality, management, procurement, program management and others. It allows both suppliers and 
buyers of electronic assemblies to “get on the same page” with respect to the outgoing quality level of the assemblies.

In IPC 610 class there are numerous topics covered. They are listed below from the IPC 610 Class for CIT’s:

•	Introduction
•	Roles and Responsibilities of IPC Registered Instructors
•	Terms and Definitions
•	Foreword
•	Handling Electronic Assemblies
•	Discrete Wiring Assembly
•	Component Installation Location/Orientation
•	Soldering
•	Mechanical Assemblies
•	Coatings
•	Laminate Conditions
•	Surface Mount Assemblies
•	Marking
•	Cleanliness
•	Review of Instructor Skills & Effective Use of Instructional Materials

The typical class for an instructor is taught in a classroom and takes 4 days to administer and test out of. While there are no hand 
soldering or wire preparation skills taught in this class there are plenty of examples which take the student through the meaning of 
the specifications, drawings, and tables as found in the standard. The class itself is lecture-based and is interspersed with photos 
to highlight some of the specifications for illustration purposes. At the end of each teaching module in the IPC 610 class, a review 
consisting of sample problems helps students and the instructors to see how well the material is being absorbed by the IPC 610 class 
instructor candidates. The testing for the IPC 610 class is done online with nearly one-half of the questions being in an open book 
format with the other half being in a closed book format. Instructors passing the IPC 610 class consist of a copy of the specification,
an instructor’s guide, a slide set of the teaching materials and a copy of the IPC-TM50 which goes through terms and definitions.

In the IPC 610 class for application specialists (CIS candidates) the modules which are useful in the particular business are taught
along with the required background modules. The background modules for the IPC 610 class are modules 1 and 2 which have to do with the
administration of the program, EOS/ESD guidelines, terms and definitions as well as things like the range of magnification required 
for inspection of the assemblies. The business then “picks and choose” other modules which are appropriate for the business. For 
example, if a firm is building wire harnesses then perhaps only the sections on soldering and wires/terminals will be instructed and
tested in the IPC 610 class. If the business is a contract manufacturer building circuit board assemblies then perhaps only the sections 
in the IPC610 class on soldering, throughhole and SMT will be useful in the business. If the business only does wire wrapping then 
perhaps the module on wire wrapping will be useful to take out of the IPC 610 class.

Whatever your need come to BEST for your IPC 610 class experience!
